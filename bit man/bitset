A std::bitset is a C++ standard library container class that provides a fixed-size array-like data structure for manipulating individual bits. 
It is part of the C++ Standard Library and is defined in the <bitset> header. Here are some key characteristics and features of the std::bitset data structure:

Fixed Size: A std::bitset has a fixed size at compile time, which means you need to specify the number of bits it can hold when you declare it.
For example, std::bitset<8> creates a bitset with 8 bits.

Storage: std::bitset stores its bits efficiently, typically using a single machine word (e.g., a 32-bit or 64-bit integer) for storage. This makes 
it memory-efficient and suitable for handling individual bits.

Indexing: Bits in a std::bitset are indexed from right to left, starting with index 0 for the least significant bit (rightmost) and increasing
towards the left for more significant bits.

Bit Manipulation: You can perform various bit manipulation operations on std::bitset objects, such as setting, clearing, toggling, and testing individual
bits. These operations are typically done using overloaded operators and member functions.

set(): Sets a specific bit to 1.
reset(): Sets a specific bit to 0.
flip(): Toggles a specific bit (changes 0 to 1 and vice versa).
test(): Checks the value of a specific bit.
Initialization: std::bitset objects can be initialized using binary, decimal, or hexadecimal literals. For example:

cpp
Copy code
std::bitset<8> bits1(0b10101010); // Initialize with binary literal
std::bitset<8> bits2(170);        // Initialize with decimal literal
std::bitset<8> bits3(0xAA);       // Initialize with hexadecimal literal
Bitwise Operations: You can perform bitwise operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) on std::bitset objects just like you would with integers. These operations are applied bit-wise to corresponding bits in two std::bitset objects.

Conversions: You can convert std::bitset objects to integers and vice versa using the to_ulong() and to_ullong() member functions. These functions allow you to retrieve the integer value represented by the bits in the bitset.

Here's a simple example of using std::bitset to manipulate individual bits:

cpp
Copy code
#include <iostream>
#include <bitset>

int main() {
    std::bitset<8> bits(0b10101010); // Initialize with binary literal

    // Manipulate bits
    bits.set(3);    // Set bit at index 3 to 1
    bits.reset(5);  // Set bit at index 5 to 0
    bits.flip(2);   // Toggle bit at index 2

    // Test bit values
    if (bits.test(1)) {
        std::cout << "Bit at index 1 is 1." << std::endl;
    }

    // Display the entire bitset
    std::cout << "Bitset: " << bits << std::endl;

    // Convert to an integer and display
    unsigned long value = bits.to_ulong();
    std::cout << "Integer value: " << value << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
In this example, we create a std::bitset object, manipulate its bits, test individual bit values, and convert it to an integer. This demonstrates some of the basic operations you can perform with std::bitset.
