1.It is possible that INT_MAX might not be the largest in some questions.SO better ue LLONG_max or ULLONG_MAX.

2.Taking XOR of even no of numbers twice creates whole array 0.

3.To associate array values with their Indexes, use vector of pair and not Map.

4.If the constraint is of order 10^5 ...cant use N^2 ...maximum allowed is NlogN

5.If we are asked to write permutation of array in easy level question,try to print from 1 to N or N to 1.
